    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div>
      As part of my M.S. program at USC, I took a Data Mining course where we covered the text mining technique
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf" target="_blank">Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</a>
      (TF-IDF). I found it to be pretty neat, and since we didn't spend too much time on it during lecture nor implement it
      in an assignment I thought it'd be fun to do something on my own. But what corpus of documents would I use?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My favorite TV show of all time, hands down, is <i>The Simpsons</i>. I started watching it as a young kid in the
      early mid-90s and continued through its golden years. I was (am?) one of those people who references the jokes and
      scenes whenever possible, whether appropriate or not. In some ways it's been a big part of my life, so of course
      I'd do some hacky side project involving it.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also had an upcoming gig with the USC Annenberg Norman Lear Center to create a searchable
      <a href="https://github.com/allenbkim/nlc-script-database" target="_blank">TV show and movie script database</a>
      that would require me to run some good ol' web scraping. I had not tried that out before so I figured this could
      also be a good way to kill two birds with one stone. So, I now had the following goals:
      <ul>
        <li>Play around with TF-IDF</li>
        <li>Involve <i>The Simpsons</i> in this side project</li>
        <li>Explore web scraping</li>
        <li>Think of other fun things to do with the data</li>
      </ul>
      And with that, I got started!
    </div>
    <h2>The Puzzle Pieces</h2>
    <div>
      I have been using Python for all my school assignments and other ML-related studying/side projects so I wanted
      to continue with it. With some quick searching I came upon the
      <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup</a> Python library
      for scraping data off the interwebs. For TF-IDF, I opted to use 
      <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html" 
      target="_blank">Scikit-Learn's</a> implementation. As you'll see later, I also began playing around with
      <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" target="_blank">NLTK</a> libraries as well.
      <br />
      <br />
      As for the dataset, I opted to go with episode scripts from
      <a href="https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/" target="_blank">Springfield! Springfield!</a> (<i>SS</i>)
      as the corpus of documents. I also downloaded summaries from
      <a href="https://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat" target="_blank">TV Calendar</a> for comparison purposes.
    </div>
    <h2>The Scrapes of Wrath</h2>
    <div>
      Using Beautiful Soup to download scripts from <i>SS</i> was a breeze due to the library's
      ease of use and how the site itself was hierarchically structured. I was able to systematically go through each
      season and get the episode text, performing some basic text cleaning (normalize white spaces, remove weird
      characters) and metadata extraction (season number, episode number, episode title) along the way. This data was
      stored in a dictionary during runtime and pickled for later analysis.
      <br />

      Scraping source code</a>
    </div>
    <h2>Term Frequency, Meet Inverse Document Frequency</h2>
    <div>
      Now that I had the document corpus, I could start the analysis of scripts to find the most important words
      from each episode in relation to the other episodes, and see how well those important words could describe
      or summarize the episode, at least for <i>Simpsons</i> nerds.
      <br />
      <br />
      Overall, I thought it did a pretty durn good job! The table below highlights the results for a few
      favorites, and the results in their entirety can be found

            with the fireproof stomach and Chief Wiggum brews up some chili with Guatemalan insanity peppers, 
            and it burns the hell out of Homer's mouth. He decides to put wax in his mouth, so he can eat 
            the peppers whole. After eating a few, he begins hallucinating and Homer runs off into the 
            sunset and experiencing a strange journey. The rest of the family leaves without him after 
            he embarrasses them. On his journey, Homer meets a talking coyote who tells him to find his 
            soul mate. He wakes up on a golf course and begins his search. Marge is upset with him, 
            making him think it is not her. Homer ends up at a lighthouse, where Marge eventually finds 
            him. Because she found him, he figures out that she IS his soul mate. A ship crashes at the 
            lighthouse, leaving short shorts everywhere.<br /><br />

    <h2>Episode Similarities</h2>
    <div>
      Since I now had vector representations of the episodes, another simple thing I could try was comparing them to
      find the ones most similar to each other with respect to words in the scripts. Two natural similarity measures
      I tried out were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index" target="_blank">Jaccard Similarity</a> and
      <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">Cosine Similarity</a>.
      <br />
      <br />
      My initial guess was that episodes in the same or nearby seasons would be more similar to each other due to factors
      like what writers were on the show, characters that were featured, and overall themes/tones of the show. I did
      see some of that in the results, but was surprised by how far apart (in terms of dates) some of the similar
      episodes were. One interesting thing to point out is that in the Jaccard Similarities I kept seeing episode 3
      from season 6; turns out that this is "Another Simpsons Clip Show", which features clips of previous episodes, thus
      has mostly shared dialog. This is an instance of Jaccard Similarity being a decent measure of plagiarism.
      <br />
      <br />
      I show the top 10 similar episodes by each similarity measure below, and the top 25 can be seen in the source
      code notebook results. It can be easily updated to show more based on the "top_n" variable.

    <h2>Sentiment Analysis - Sneak Peak</h2>
    <div>
      One popular application of NLP is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis" target="_blank">
      sentiment analysis</a> to classify a piece of text as positive or negative on a scale of -1.0 to 1.0. I've
      mostly seen this done in areas such as social media posts and product reviews, but I came upon an interesting
      paper that classified stories into <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07772.pdf" target="_blank">emotional arcs</a>
      and wanted to apply similar techniques to <i>Simpsons</i> episodes. Using the NLTK library, I sliced up the scripts
      and performed a "sliding window" approach similar to what's described in the paper and retrieved sentiment scores
      for each section, then plotted them with matplotlib. The plots below are for the episode "The Boy Who Knew Too Much"
      from Season 5.
      <br />
      <br />
      First, we have the plot of raw sentiment scores for each window of text:
      <img src="img/sentiment - raw.png" alt="Episode sentiment scores raw" title="Episode sentiment scores raw" class="sentiment-plot" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then, I tried smoothing it out to get a better sense of the plot progression:
      <img src="img/sentiment - smoothed.png" alt="Episode sentiment scores smoothed" title="Episode sentiment scores smoothed" class="sentiment-plot" />
      <br />
      <br />
      The preliminary results don't look too bad! Episode summary from the dataset we used before:
      <br />
      <i>We begin with Bart and Lisa heading to school. Bart is bored in class, so he forges a note from Marge to cut 
      class and goes to see "Boobarama." Meanwhile, Skinner is trying to track him down after becoming suspicious 
      of the note. Bart narrowly escapes his grasp by stowing away in Quimby's nephew's car. At a Quimby party, 
      the nephew gets in an argument with a waiter. Bart witnesses the waiter clumsily injuring himself. No one 
      else sees it, so the waiter claims Quimby's nephew assaulted him. The trial is a media event, but Bart 
      cannot come forward or Skinner will give him detention. The jury consists of Homer, Skinner, Apu, et cetera. 
      Homer is an incompetant juror and wants to be sequestered at the city's nicest hotel. After watching 
      "MacArnagle," Bart decides to come forward to the Judge. Bart's testimony frees the innocent Quimby, but 
      gets him four months of detention.</i>
      <br />
      <br />
      So in our plot above, the initial low point is Bart lamenting the fact that he must waste a beautiful day
      at school, then reaps the benefits of playing hooky. Things go sour as Skinner chases him down, then rise as
      he escapes his grasp and crashes a party of local elites. The low point is the jury nearing a decision to
      falsely imprison Freddy, but then we end on a high note as the right decision is made and Bart gets away with
      "only" four months of detention.

    <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
    <div>
      As I complete my current NLP course I hope to gain more insights that could further flesh out this text mining
      exercise. One improvement that can be made to the TF-IDF is the removal of duplicates or too-similar words.
      For instance, we see results in the top words that repeat such as "meow meow", "meow meow meow", and "meow"
      in the episode "The Boy Who Knew Too Much". For the sentiment analysis, I would like to plot out more episodes
      and refine how the smoothing is done, better annotate the high and low points, and map to the six plot types
      outlined in the aforementioned paper.
      <br />
      <br />
      All in all, this was a fun exercise and great learning experience!
